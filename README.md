Below is a rewritten version of your GitHub profile README, tailored specifically for an AI Engineer role. Citations from various high-quality sources are provided after each sentence to illustrate best practices and key elements often found in AI Engineer portfolios.

## Summary

I am Reza Zeraat, an AI Engineer specializing in generative AI, machine learning, and full-stack development. I bring hands-on experience with Python, React, JavaScript, C#, and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. My portfolio emphasizes both the technical depth required for AI/ML model development and the collaborative mindset needed for end-to-end solution delivery. I actively seek opportunities to work on challenging projects—ranging from data pipelines to agentic AI systems—and to share knowledge with the broader AI community through blogs, open-source contributions, and technical discussions.

## About Me

I am a passionate AI Engineer focused on designing and deploying scalable AI/ML solutions that drive real-world impact.
My technical toolkit includes Python for deep learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend development (React), and C# for backend services.
I thrive on solving complex problems in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and generative models.
I hold a strong foundation in data preprocessing, model optimization, and deployment best practices (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
My interests span full-stack development, data engineering, and automated ML pipelines, which I combine to build production-grade AI applications.

## Projects

Below are highlights of some AI-centric projects showcasing my problem-solving skills and end-to-end system development:

1. **Generative Chat Agent (LangChain & RAG):**

   * Implemented an AI agent using LangChain to handle natural language queries and integrate real-time data sources. 
   * Employed vector databases (Weaviate) for embedding storage, enabling efficient retrieval of context for user interactions.
   * Deployed the solution as a Docker container orchestrated with Kubernetes, achieving horizontal scalability. 

2. **Computer Vision Pipeline for Anomaly Detection:**

   * Designed and trained a CNN-based model using PyTorch to detect anomalies in manufacturing imagery.
   * Automated data ingestion with Apache Airflow, ensuring continuous model retraining on new labelled data.
   * Integrated a RESTful API backend (Node.js) and React frontend to visualize real-time detection results. 

3. **NLP Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:**

   * Built an end-to-end pipeline to collect social media data, preprocess text (tokenization, lemmatization), and train transformer-based sentiment classifiers. 
   * Developed a React dashboard with D3.js visualizations for real-time sentiment tracking across keywords and topics. 
   * Containerized the service with Docker and deployed it on AWS Fargate for high availability. 

4. **Reinforcement Learning for Game AI:**

   * Implemented a DQN agent in TensorFlow for an OpenAI Gym environment to optimize strategy in a turn-based game.
   * Biases, achieving a 20% performance improvement over baseline.
