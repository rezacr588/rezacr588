# Hey, I'm Reza Zeraat 👋

**AI Engineer** building intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning, generative AI, and full-stack development.

I design and deploy production-grade AI solutions—from fine-tuned LLMs and RAG pipelines to computer vision systems. Currently focused on agentic AI, legal AI applications, and making complex ML accessible through clean engineering.

## What I Work With

**AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Hugging Face, RAG, LLM fine-tuning  
**Full-Stack:** React, Node.js, TypeScript, C#, GraphQL  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure ML, Apache Airflow

## Featured Projects

**🤖 Generative Chat Agent**  
LangChain-powered conversational AI with RAG architecture. Uses Weaviate for vector storage, deployed on Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.

**👁️ Anomaly Detection Pipeline**  
PyTorch CNN for manufacturing defect detection. Automated retraining via Airflow, React dashboard for real-time visualization.

**📊 Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**  
End-to-end NLP pipeline: data collection → transformer classification → D3.js visualizations. Deployed on AWS Fargate.

**🎮 Game AI with Reinforcement Learning**  
DQN agent in TensorFlow for strategic game optimization. Achieved 20% performance improvement over baseline.
